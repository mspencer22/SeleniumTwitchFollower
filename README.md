# SeleniumTwitchFollower
An app that uses selenium to copy follows from one twitch.tv account to another

This app uses Maven to manage it's dependencies, which are:
- Junit Jupiter 5.8.1
- Selenium Java 4.3.1

To run this application, run the ***App.java*** file in main.

I've also included the test files, as this program was intended to showcase my ability. 
You don't need those to run the program, however.
